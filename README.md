This repository contains multiple data science projects that cover various techniques and methodologies in machine learning, data analysis, and visualization. This mainly caters to the basic concepts and understanding of data science.
The projects are as follows:

1.Linear Regression (Normal Equation and Gradient Descent)
2.Color Image Compression using PCA
3.Predicting Stock Prices using Pandas
4.Visualizing the Best Line of Best Fit in Linear Regression

Each project demonstrates key concepts and implementation details in data science. Below is a brief description of each project.

# 1. Linear Regression: Normal Equation and Gradient Descent
This project covers the implementation of linear regression using two different methods:

 a) Normal Equation:
The Normal Equation method is used to directly compute the optimal parameters (weights) for linear regression without the need for iterative optimization.

It is useful when the number of features (or dimensions) is small.

 b) Gradient Descent:
In this method, the algorithm iteratively adjusts the parameters to minimize the cost function.

This is more scalable for problems with large datasets and a high number of features.

Key Concepts:

Cost function: Measures the difference between predicted and actual values.

Gradient descent: Iterative optimization algorithm to minimize the cost function.

Normal equation: A direct solution to the linear regression problem.

 # 2. Color Image Compression Using PCA
This project demonstrates image compression using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a powerful technique in dimensionality reduction.

PCA for Image Compression:
PCA is applied to compress a color image by reducing the number of principal components.

The project uses Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors to capture the most important features of an image, thereby reducing its size while retaining key information.

Key Concepts:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): A technique for reducing the dimensionality of data while retaining most of the variance.

Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues: Mathematical tools for identifying the principal components.

Image compression: Reducing the amount of data required to represent an image.

# 3. Predicting Stock Prices Using Pandas
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using historical stock market data with Pandas.

Stock Price Prediction:
The project uses time-series data and applies basic data manipulation techniques with Pandas to prepare and clean the data.

It then uses simple statistical methods to predict future stock prices.

Key Concepts:
Time-series data: Data points indexed by time, typically used for forecasting.

Pandas: A Python library for data manipulation and analysis, specifically for structured data.

Stock price prediction: Forecasting the future prices of stocks using historical data.

# 4. Visualizing the Best Line of Best Fit in Linear Regression
This project focuses on the visualization of linear regression results.

Line of Best Fit Visualization:
The project generates a plot that shows the line of best fit for a given dataset, illustrating how well the model fits the data.

It helps visualize how different values of the independent variable impact the dependent variable.

Key Concepts:
Linear regression: A method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

Line of best fit: A straight line that best represents the data points in a scatter plot.
